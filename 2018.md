# In 2018 expect...

* Nothing will change or slow the usage or popularity of React for many years to come.
* GraphQL is quickly coming for your REST API.
* The web becomes more native with offline capabilities and seamless mobile experiences.
* HTML 5.3 is [coming](https://www.w3.org/blog/2017/12/html-5-2-is-done-html-5-3-is-coming/).
* Keep an eye on [turbo](https://medium.com/@ericsimons/introducing-turbo-5x-faster-than-yarn-npm-and-runs-natively-in-browser-cc2c39715403).
* Expect CSS Flebbox, grid, ... Learn them.
* [JavaScript usage will continue to grow](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2017#technology-programming-languages) with no [slowdown in sight](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2017#technology-most-popular-languages-by-occupation).
* Still waiting on [Web Assembly](http://webassembly.org/) to peak. This will likely require tooling.
* Universal/isomorphic JavaScript solutions continue to evolve e.g. [next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js) and [Sapper](https://sapper.svelte.technology/).
* Web components still lurking and wait for significant traction by developers that might never come to be.
* I believe the end is in sight for CSS pre-processors as [CSSnext](http://cssnext.io/) takes over.
