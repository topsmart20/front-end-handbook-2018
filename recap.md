# Recap of Front-end Development in 2017

* [React 16 aka fiber is released](https://reactjs.org/blog/2017/09/26/react-v16.0.html). 
* React begins to rival JQuery in popularity in certain contexts. 
* React [clearly](https://twitter.com/npmjs/status/949017852702543876) is the [most used](https://www.npmjs.com/npm/state-of-javascript-frameworks-2017-part-1) tool [for building UI's](https://stackoverflow.blog/2018/01/11/brutal-lifecycle-javascript-frameworks/) with state.
* Facebook sheds its React BSD license for the MIT license (same for Jest, Flow, Immutable.js, and GraphQL)
* [GraphQL](https://dev-blog.apollodata.com/2017-the-year-in-graphql-124a050d04c6) got [hot in 2017](https://www.graphql.com/case-studies/). And its coming for your REST API's.
* Facebook continues to [take charge in the development space](https://code.facebook.com/projects/) with forthcoming tools like [prepack.io](https://prepack.io/).
* As expected [ECMA-262 edition 8 is released](https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm).
* [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/) finally stabilizes.
* HTML 5.2 is [done](https://www.w3.org/blog/2017/12/html-5-2-is-done-html-5-3-is-coming/).
* It was a banner year for [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) in terms of adoption and popularity.
* The [great](https://medium.com/@jerrylowm/the-death-of-front-end-developers-803a95e0f411) divide between a front-end HTML & CSS developer v.s. [front-end application developer is realized/verbalized](https://medium.com/@mandy.michael/is-there-any-value-in-people-who-cannot-write-javascript-d0a66b16de06).
* This year seemed fuller than most of solutions trying to contend with the mainstream javascript app tools (i.e. [React, Angular, and Vue etc...](https://stateofjs.com/2017/front-end/results)) Let me list them for you. [Moon](http://moonjs.ga/docs/overview.html), [Marko](https://markojs.com/), [Hyperapp](https://github.com/hyperapp/hyperapp), [Quasar Framework](http://quasar-framework.org/), [POI](https://poi.js.org), [frint](https://frint.js.org/), [BunnyJS](https://bunnyjs.com/), [jsblocks](http://jsblocks.com/), [Sapper](https://sapper.svelte.technology/), [Stimulus](https://github.com/stimulusjs/stimulus), [Choo](https://github.com/choojs/choo), 
* This was the year that jsbin and jsfiddle evolved to things like [StackBliz](https://stackblitz.com/) and [codeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/). Making it dead simple to share a working React app.
* React continues to be flattered by things like [preact](https://preactjs.com/), [inferno](https://infernojs.org/), [nerv](https://github.com/NervJS/nerv), [dva](https://github.com/dvajs/dva), and [rax](https://github.com/alibaba/rax).
* Cheatsheets got organized with [devhints.io](https://devhints.io/).
* We figured out that the correct pattern for an app boilerplate/cli tool is something very opinionated like [React Create App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) with the ability to [escape](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#npm-run-eject) from it when needed.
* Most developers have found that the combination of a really good code editor and eslint and [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) plugins make writing code faster and easier.
* CSS flexbox and grid get supported and lots more developers start paying attention to both.
* We [get](https://blog.chromium.org/2017/05/chrome-59-beta-headless-chromium-native.html), a [headless chrome](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/lkgr/headless/README.md).
* You no longer need Less or Sass [to do](https://shoelace.style) amazing [things with CSS](http://cssnext.io/features/).
* CSS [revolutions/revolts](http://ryanogles.by/css/javascript/2017/05/25/the-state-of-css.html) are under way.
* JavaScript explorer tools have arrived, [JavaScript Array Explorer](https://sdras.github.io/array-explorer/)
and [JavaScript Object Explorer](https://sdras.github.io/object-explorer/). This is a handy interface pattern for learning about JavaScript data types (e.g. Objects and Arrays) and their methods. 
* The [Chrome web browser dominates the market](http://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share) and people begin to fear the past might be [repeating itself](https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/4/16805216/google-chrome-only-sites-internet-explorer-6-web-standards).
* [Brave](https://brave.com/) becomes the most pleasant and safest way to browser the internet.
* [PhantomJS is no longer maintained](https://www.infoq.com/news/2017/04/Phantomjs-future-uncertain), [Headless Chrome](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/lkgr/headless/README.md) and [Puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer) step in.
* [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) comes from left field and becomes a stable for development.

***

* The year of the [UI component, and tree of UI components](http://developer.telerik.com/featured/front-end-application-frameworks-component-architectures/), for building complex UI's.
* No longer mainstream development blasphemy: components being constructed from a single file, potentially contain HTML, CSS, and JS, IN ONE FILE!
* [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), [Redux](http://redux.js.org/), [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), ECMAScript 2015 (aka ES6), and [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) gain massive adoption. These solutions [rise](http://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2016#technology-trending-tech-on-stack-overflow) [to](https://ashleynolan.co.uk/blog/frontend-tooling-survey-2016-results#js-bundlers) [the](https://ashleynolan.co.uk/blog/frontend-tooling-survey-2016-results#js-framework-essential) [top](http://stateofjs.com/2016/frontend/) [of](http://stateofjs.com/2016/flavors/) [all](http://stateofjs.com/2016/buildtools/) the polls as the most used tech.
* Developers realized, in most cases, HTML 5 hybrid mobile development via webviews doesn't provide enough wins when building native apps.
* [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) and [NativeScript](https://www.nativescript.org/) start to replace mobile HTML5 hybrid webview development.
* [Many abandon](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/why-i-left-gulp-and-grunt-for-npm-scripts-3d6853dd22b8#.f9waa6mnx) Gulp for NPM scripts, but Gulp remains popular.
* SASS remains a popular tool, while [PostCSS (+ CSSNext) gains ground](https://tylergaw.com/articles/sass-to-postcss).
* Linting/Hinting [HTML](http://htmlhint.com/), [CSS](http://stylelint.io/), and [JavaScript](http://eslint.org/) is a thing most developers do (ESlint replaces [JShint](http://jshint.com/) & [JSCS](http://jscs.info/) merges into ESLint).
* A trend of developers abandoning Sublime and Atom for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) begins.
* [jQuery remains](https://trends.builtwith.com/javascript), but usage/interest is [declining](https://www.google.com/trends/explore?q=jQuery). [jQuery 3 was released](https://blog.jquery.com/2016/06/09/jquery-3-0-final-released/), much like a tree falling in a forest that nobody hears.
* [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) continues to gain converts. Deservingly so!
* JavaScript functional programming & patterns [get](https://www.manning.com/books/functional-programming-in-javascript) [a](https://github.com/MostlyAdequate/mostly-adequate-guide) [lot](https://github.com/getify/Functional-Light-JS) [of](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCO1cgjhGzsSYb1rsB4bFe4Q) attention.
* [Offline development](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/getting-started/codelabs/offline/) & [Progressive Web Apps](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/) go mainstream.
* Microsoft [shows up and contributes](http://developer.telerik.com/featured/microsoft-done-lately/).
* Developing native applications for windows, OSX, and linux using things like [NW.js](https://nwjs.io/) and [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/) via web technologies becomes a thing.
* [Angular 2](https://angular.io/) (in the future aka "[Angular](https://juristr.com/blog/2016/12/let-me-explain-angular-release-cycles/)") gets off the pot and most realize it will never be as mainstream as Angular 1.
* JavaScript broadly remains at the [center](http://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2016#technology-top-tech-on-stack-overflow) [of](http://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2016#technology-most-popular-technologies) [software](http://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2016#technology-correlated-technologies) technologies.
* More developers start caring about tooling (e.g. automation) and testing.
* [Static site generators](https://www.staticgen.com/) are [taken](https://github.com/vigetlabs/blendid) [seriously](https://phenomic.io/).
* [CSS Grid excitement grows](http://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2016/12/05/css-grid/) and the future looks bright.
* [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) gets some competition from [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/).
* The next evolution of React-like solutions shows up via [Preact](https://preactjs.com/), [Deku](https://github.com/anthonyshort/deku), [Rax](https://github.com/alibaba/rax), and [inferno](https://infernojs.org/) showcasing evolution without much API change.
* Mostly people learn to accept [JSX](https://facebook.github.io/jsx/), and now they can't imagine not using it.
* A workable CSS module pattern (CSS encapsulation) is actualized and used, thus [CSS in JS](https://github.com/MicheleBertoli/css-in-js) becomes a viable solution for many.
* More people turning to UI functional/integration testing including concepts like visual [CSS](https://css-tricks.com/automating-css-regression-testing/) & RWD regression testing.
* The days of [battling](https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/) [inconsistent browser API's](https://html5test.com/results/desktop.html) are almost behind us due to a massive decline in usage and development for [older versions of IE](https://www.netmarketshare.com/browser-market-share.aspx?qprid=2&qpcustomd=0).
* Most everyone realized they will have to have a [multi-device strategy](http://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/images/iot/guide-to-iot-infographic.png) plan when developing for the web
* More developers, from other languages, continue to flood the JavaScript space bringing with them things like [type checking](https://flowtype.org/) and an [obsession with class syntax and OOP concepts](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).
* Front-end devs are introduced to [Hot Module replacement techniques and time travel debugging](https://code-cartoons.com/hot-reloading-and-time-travel-debugging-what-are-they-3c8ed2812f35#.ezlpqez1i).
* More waiting for a native [JavaScript browser module loader](https://whatwg.github.io/loader/).
* [Enforcing CSS](https://css-tricks.com/stylelint/) and [JavaScript style conventions](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/packages/eslint-config-airbnb) becomes more important (considering ES3 to ES6 code and CSS pre-processors syntactical variations)
* A small but noticeable number of developers are starting to [choose Elm over JavaScript](https://www.brianthicks.com/post/2016/04/22/state-of-elm-2016-results/).
* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) gets some serious use and fanboys.
* http://aurelia.io/ becomes the [smart choice for enterprise developers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6I_GwgoGm1w&t=3315s) (i.e. support!).
* [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/) gets its act [together](https://opencollective.com/webpack) and solidifies is position over the superior [JSPM](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/javascript-systemjs-jspm) solution.
* [HTTPS, yeah, we're serious about that.](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2016/10/avoid-not-secure-warn)
* [BASH](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/about) on windows happens.
* The [notifications API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Notifications_API/Using_the_Notifications_API) gets used and abused for chrome users, but only after you give it permission.
* [Firebug officially dead](https://github.com/firebug/firebug).
* CSS [20 years young](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS20/) in 2016.
* [Immutability](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/) concepts run rapid.
