Getting a Front-end Developer Job: Interview Preperation and Learning Resources
=================================

**Overview:**

An examination on how one becomes a front-end developer.

* * *

Self-directed Training/Education
--------------------------------

The individual who is self-directing their education for the purpose of becoming a professional front-end developer should ease themselves into learning the field of front-end development. First, start small and take in what can be found on the internet for free. For example, start by consuming the materials at [MDN "Learn web development"](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn), [freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/), or [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css).

With a peek into the world of front-end development completed, one should next invest roughly $30.00 dollars a month into some non-accredited, on-demand, online video courses, and interactive lessons. For example, follow a recommended learning path from [Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/learn/), [LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/paths/explore-a-career-in-front-end-web-development), or [Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/paths/building-websites-with-html-css-and-javascript), and try your hand at [codecademy.com](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/web-development).

After cutting your teeth on the learning materials just mentioned, and you are determined to continue on, use this Frontend Masters Roadmap & Guides to direct your education on front-end development.

Directed Training/Education
---------------------------

If the self-directed route is too overwhelming, the following more traditional training/educational routes can be taken:

1.  Complete a non-accredited online or in-person bootcamp/course/program (Find one at [Course Report](https://www.coursereport.com/schools?track=Front+End+Web+Development&subject=Front+End&type=&cost=&start_date=&location=) or [Switchup.org](https://www.switchup.org/rankings/best-coding-bootcamps)).
2.  Complete an accredited two-year or four-year college education from an institution which offers a degree in web development.

Today, both of these options offer online and in-person programs.

4.  Contribute to an open-source project or start your own.
5.  Author JavaScript packages and publish them on npm.
