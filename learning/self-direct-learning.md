# Self Directed Learning

This section focuses on free and paid resources (video training, books, etc.) that an individual can use to direct their own learning process and career as a front-end developer.

The learning resources mentioned (articles, books, videos, screencasts etc..) will include both free and paid material. Paid material will be indicated with [$].

The author believes that anyone with the right determination and dedication can teach themselves how to be a front-end developer. All that is required is a computer connected to the web and some cash for books and online video training. 

Below are a few video learning outlets (tech focused) I generally recommend pulling content from:
