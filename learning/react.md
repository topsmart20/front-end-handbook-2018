###### NOTES:

Once you have a good handle on React you might consider looking at [Preact](https://preactjs.com/) or [Inferno](https://infernojs.org/), or both. When you have Redux mastered, take a look [MobX](https://mobx.js.org/) or consider creating your own small custom Redux like implementation from scratch.
